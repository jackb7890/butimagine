Random notes & things I plan on doing will go here.
-A dash in front indicates something that can actually "be done" instead of just notes or yapping.

-Make Map compatible with textures & tiles.
	The tilemap would have the same basic output as what we have currently but function differently.
	Tilemap needs to track things on a tiles basis as well as coodrinates.
	Probably best off as a different class that extends Map.

-Add Tiles struct
	Extends MapEntity (maybe).
	Include unique collision properties, scalable size

-Move MapEntities to new file.
	Future files for NPCs & Players will want to use MapEntities class without including all the worldmaking shit

-Clean up "world" file to only include things used for the world making.
	Self explanitory it's very cluttered atm.

These all can be done after the tiles, in order.
-Add mouse controls
-Add pathfinding movement
	Get it working first, then later make it runescape accurate.
-Add a camera
	Requires we split Map dimensions from Window Dimensions
	Need some kind of algorithm to convert map coords -> window coords
-Expand the map/scrollable map
	"grid" Will be the coords of the whole map, even if it extends beyond the display window.
	SDL has a sort of built in coordinates system, but it's based on the window size & position.
	0,0 to SDL will always just be the top left corner of the window.
	If we want a scrolling map, or a map that's bigger than the window, it'll need it's own coords.
	We will then have to convert the Map coords to the Display coords for rendering.
	I think.
-Add gameticks
	May need to move ALL events to it's own file.
