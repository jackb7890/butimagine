Random notes & things I plan on doing will go here.
-A dash in front indicates something that can actually "be done" instead of just notes or yapping.

-Clean world files & main(?)
	I commented out a lot of things that can now be removed.
	Also a lot of currently unused functions.
-	Probably best to move unused things to a "junkyard" for now.

-Make Display compatible with textures
	Textures use a different SDL function to render
-	I think a simple if statement will do. If the map entity has a texture, render that instead of the RGB color.

-Make Map compatible with textures & tiles.
	The tilemap would have the same basic output as what we have currently but function differently.
	This requires the overwriting stuff to all be fixed first.
	Tilemap needs to track things on a tiles basis as well as coodrinates.
	Probably best off as a different class that extends Map.

-Add Tiles struct
	Extends MapEntity (maybe).
	Include unique collision properties, scalable size

-Move gameentities to new file.
	Future files for NPCs & Players will want to use GameEntities class without including all the worldmaking shit

-Clean up "world" file to only include things used for the world making.
	Self explanitory it's very cluttered atm.

-Delete tilemap.cpp & .hpp
	I just move them to World.cpp but I think deleting the files might break cmake.

These all can be done after the tiles, in order.
-Add mouse controls
-Add pathfinding movement
	Get it working first, then later make it runescape accurate.
-Add a camera
	Requires we split Map dimensions from Window Dimensions
	Need some kind of algorithm to convert map coords -> window coords
-Expand the map/scrollable map
	"grid" Will be the coords of the whole map, even if it extends beyond the display window.
	SDL has a sort of built in coordinates system, but it's based on the window size & position.
	0,0 to SDL will always just be the top left corner of the window.
	If we want a scrolling map, or a map that's bigger than the window, it'll need it's own coords.
	We will then have to convert the Map coords to the Display coords for rendering.
	I think.
-Add gameticks
	May need to move ALL events to it's own file.
